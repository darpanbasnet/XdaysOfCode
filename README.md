# XdaysOfCode

This repository is where I will keep track of my progress as I learn C programming and other programming concepts. 
I am very interested in computer science and am constantly looking for ways to improve my skills and knowledge. 
 As I learn new concepts, I'll share code examples, links to useful resources, and my own thoughts and insights. 
I welcome feedback and contributions from others, so please submit pull requests or leave comments with your own ideas.  
I hope that by sharing my experience, I can inspire others to learn more about programming and assist them on their journey. 
Thank you for sticking with me!

Happy Coding ❤️
